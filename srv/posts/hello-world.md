## Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on software engineering, game development,
and whatever else catches my interest.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Technical deep-dives** — Exploring interesting problems I've solved
- **Project updates** — Progress on runeforge and other side projects
- **Industry thoughts** — My takes on trends and tools

## Why a Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly. It forces me to organize my thoughts and understand topics more deeply.
If others find it useful, that's a bonus.

Stay tuned for more posts!
